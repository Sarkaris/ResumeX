## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a modern Server Component-driven architecture.

1.  **User Input:** The user provides a resume, job title, and job description on a client-side form.
2.  **Server Action:** The form submission securely calls a Next.js Server Action.
3.  **Backend Processing:** The server action parses the resume file, formats the data, and sends a detailed prompt to the Google Gemini API.
4.  **AI Analysis:** The Gemini API returns a structured JSON object containing the complete analysis.
5.  **Data Transfer:** The server action encodes the result, stores it in a secure, temporary cookie, and redirects the user.
6.  **Results Page:** The dynamic results page reads the data from the cookie and renders the professional report dashboard.
